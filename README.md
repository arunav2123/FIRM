1. Monte-Carlo simualtion code for collisional particle transport from \
      a. Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) \
      b. Ion-Cyclotron Radio Frequency (ICRF)\
    c. DT fusion born energetic particles

3. In-built Resonant Magnetic Perturbation (RMP) Coil Construction (Up-down symmetric) \
    a. User-defined parameters-> Phase Perturbations, Coil Engeneering, Inductances, (R,Z) Location \
    b. Calculates Vaccum Field from Bio-Savart Law \
    c. Computes Atomic Ionization timescale & slowing down distribution \
    d. Inlcusion of Plasma response to RMP (in progress) 

5. Runaway Electron Mitigation Coil (REMC) (Implementation in progress)
